# Column drain simulation
## For random hits generation
### - arch_sim.py is the main script
### - plotting.py gives simple processing of data 
## For MC datast
### - arch_sim_MC.py is the main script
### - plotting_MC.py selects the hits data, starts the simulation and stores the simulation results into pickle files
### - dataplay.py provides some basic data processing and plotting
### - get_trigger.py is a script to retrieve the trigger information from the dataset. In pricinple, the trigger in the dataset is just a random trigger at 4MHz, and thus gives no difference with any random trigger generated by youself.
### - for monte carlo dataset, one can download from https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/N5GRpLCHSwR9sm7
